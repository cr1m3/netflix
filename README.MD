# Netflix Account Checker
## Easy selenium account checker
### Have a Netflix combo-list? Name it 'netflix' and check it out.

Checks accounts by Country, depending on your IP. You will need to change the split-method depending on how the combo-list was generated.

You also need to change VPN, in case you get a status 403 due to too many requests.

Built for Debian/Kali linux terminal (gnome). Enjoy.
