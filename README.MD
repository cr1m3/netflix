# Netflix Account Checker
## Easy Webdriver Account Checker
### Have a Netflix Combo-List? Name it 'netflix' and check it out.

![Alt text](assets/pic.png "Netflix Checker running on Kali")

Checks accounts by Country, depending on your IP. No headless mode for now, as unexpected behaviour occurs, despite adding user-agent metadata.

Is able to determine how to split the combo-list, depending on how it was generated by OpenBullet or similar program (i.e. single pipe, double pipe, no info etc...) More methods will probably be added as I find them and if I can be arsed.

Added the ability to resume, in case there is a 403 error due to too many requests being issued. Change your VPN and restart the program, and it will resume where it left off.

Built for Debian/Kali linux terminal (gnome). Enjoy.
